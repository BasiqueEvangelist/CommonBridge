Patbox's [Common Protection API](https://github.com/Patbox/common-protection-api) and [Common Economy API](https://github.com/Patbox/common-economy-api) are useful for unifying protection and economy checks, but they aren't used by everybody. **Common Bridgeâ„¢** includes providers for a variety of mods so that the Common \* APIs can be safely used by modders.
